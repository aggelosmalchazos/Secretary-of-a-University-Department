# Secretary-of-a-University-Department
Implementation of a secretary department built in c++

This projects simulates the secretary department of a university department. You can:
1.Add a professor or a student

2.Delete a professor or a student
3.Add or delete a course
4.Assign a professor to a course
5.Enroll a student to a course
6.Print and save the students that passed a specific course
7.Print your students' scores in your courses
8.Print your scores for this semester and for all semesters
9.Print all graduates
10.Display and save secretary contents
11.Print enrolled students of a specific course
12.Print academic transcript of a specific student

When you run the program the students, professors and courses are loaded automatically (they are read from the people.txt and courses.txt files). When you press 0 to exit the program, these files are set to the contents of the secretary records. 

In the extras.txt file there extra students, professors and courses. 

Most courses are from the CS department of Harvard School of Engineering and (most) names are AI generated.

Warning: When a specific person is asked (for example function no4), we need to provide a valid name that already exists in the data, otherwise a segmentation fault occurs.
